# CreateDateFolder

A minimal Windows GUI application built with GitHub Actions using MinGW-w64. Automatically creates a folder named after the current date in `YY-MM-DD` style.

Made using ChatGPT, so there is no copyright. Licence files shows CC0. The only human action was fixing bugs. It's a shameful code.
